    "# About the topic:\n",
    "A stroke is a serious medical emergency that happens when blood flow to the brain is cut off. This can be caused by either a blockage in an artery (ischemic stroke) or bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). When this happens, brain cells start to die, leading to sudden neurological problems. Recognizing the signs of stroke and acting quickly is crucial to minimize brain damage and improve recovery chances."
